# Write a program that draws “modular rectangles” like the ones below. The user specifies the
# width and height of the rectangle, and the entries start at 0 and increase typewriter fashion
# from left to right and top to bottom, but are all done mod 10. Below are examples of a 3 × 5
# rectangle and a 4 × 8 .

width = eval(input("Enter Width: "))
height = eval(input("Enter Height: "))

for i in range(0, width*height, 1):
    print("")
    for j in range(0+i, width+i, 1):
        print(j % 10, end="")
